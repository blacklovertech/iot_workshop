## Fact 

🤯 Lesser-Known IoT Facts & Concepts

1. LoRa (Long Range) – A wireless technology that allows IoT devices to communicate over long distances with very low power consumption. Used in smart agriculture and city-wide IoT networks.


2. MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) – A lightweight messaging protocol for IoT, allowing devices to communicate efficiently with minimal data usage.


3. NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT) – A low-power cellular network designed for IoT devices that require long battery life and deep indoor coverage.


4. Edge Computing in IoT – Instead of sending all data to the cloud, edge devices (ESP32, Raspberry Pi) process some data locally, reducing latency and bandwidth use.


5. IoT SIM Cards – Special SIMs used in smart meters, GPS trackers, and connected vehicles to ensure reliable data transmission over cellular networks.


6. Digital Twin Technology – Creating a virtual replica of a physical object (like a machine or building) that updates in real-time using IoT data.


7. LPWAN (Low-Power Wide-Area Network) – A category of wireless networks (like LoRaWAN, Sigfox) designed for IoT devices needing low power and long-range connectivity.


8. Smart Dust – Tiny IoT sensors, sometimes as small as grains of sand, used to monitor environmental conditions, air quality, or industrial processes.


9. Zigbee & Z-Wave – Alternative to Wi-Fi & Bluetooth, these wireless protocols are used in smart homes and industrial IoT for low-power device communication.


10. IoT-Based Energy Harvesting – Some IoT devices can generate their own power from solar, vibration, or radio waves, reducing battery dependency.


11. IoT and Blockchain – Used together for secure and tamper-proof IoT data logging, especially in supply chains and financial transactions.


12. ESP-NOW Protocol (ESP32/ESP8266) – A Wi-Fi-based communication method that enables fast, low-power peer-to-peer connections between ESP devices without the internet.


13. Underwater IoT (U-IoT) – IoT used for underwater temperature monitoring, oceanography, and marine life tracking using sonar-based communication.


14. IoT in Smart Textiles – Clothes embedded with sensors to monitor health vitals, body posture, or even change color.


15. Self-Healing IoT Networks – Networks that can detect faults and automatically reroute connections to maintain device communication.
